*COMPANY*: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*: ZUHAYR YASSER NONGBRI

*INTERN ID*: CTIS3566

*DOMAIN*: MACHINE LEARNING

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH

*DESCRIPTION*: 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation, visualization, and analysis of a Decision Tree Classifier using the scikit-learn library. A synthetically generated, highly separable dataset is used to train the model, allowing it to achieve high classification accuracy (97–99%) while maintaining strong interpretability.

The project is designed to help understand how decision trees make decisions based on feature splits and how model performance can be evaluated using standard metrics.
