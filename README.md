*DESCRIPTION*: Decision Tree Classification on Breast Cancer Dataset
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, a real-world medical dataset commonly used for machine learning research and education. The objective is to classify tumors as benign or malignant based on diagnostic features extracted from cell nuclei images.

The project focuses on model interpretability, performance evaluation, and visualization of decision-making rules.

🎯 Objectives

Build a Decision Tree classification model

Use a real and reliable medical dataset

Visualize the decision tree structure

Evaluate model performance using standard metrics
